# CS5300_Project
You are expected to write a part of an SQL compiler. The compiler will read (scan) a set of SQL queries as input and perform the following steps for each query: 
1. The input query is scanned to identify different entities, operations, and order of execution. 
2. The input query is then translated into its equivalent relational algebra. 
3. The generated relational expression is then mapped into a query tree. 
4. You will write a report about your compiler. Your report must be selfexplanatory, clearly explaining the structure of your compiler, the operation of the scanner, …, and a justification of its correctness.

Please make note of the following: 
1. The test data will be made available on the course web site on October 19. 
2. The due date of the project is firm and will not change under any circumstances. 
3. Each group is expected to submit in class a hard copy of the report along, with a print-out of the compiler. The compiler is expected to be well- documented. 
4. SQL queries could be nested, consisting of set and relational operators, aggregate functions, IN, EXISTS, …. 
5. Please note that randomly-selected groups may be asked to demo their project and execute it on input data
